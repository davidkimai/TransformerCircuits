# README.md
# Course: A Practical Path Through “A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits”
This repository translates the paper’s structure into a step-by-step learning path for newcomers. Each module mirrors a section of the paper and aims to make core ideas accessible while pointing to production-minded considerations (conceptual only). By the end, learners should be able to discuss residual streams, QK/OV circuits, composition patterns, and induction heads, and relate them to practical interpretability workflows and secure usage patterns.

All module files include short descriptions; where the paper does not specify details, lessons say “To be specified.” to avoid guessing.

# 01-Summary-of-Results/README.md
# Summary of Results
This lesson orients learners to the paper’s main findings: bigram behavior in zero-layer models, skip-trigram structure in one-layer attention-only models, and the emergence of induction heads in two-layer models. The goal is to set expectations for the rest of the course, highlighting how composition unlocks richer in-context learning. Production-aware learners should note that these mechanisms connect to debugging, evaluation, and risk analysis in deployed systems. To be specified where the paper omits operational specifics.

---

# 02-Transformer-Overview/README.md
# Transformer Overview
This module reviews the high-level model layout and introduces the interpretability lens used throughout the paper. The main goal is to align on concepts like residual streams and attention heads as additive, independent contributors. Learners will see why an interpretable mathematical framing can differ from efficient implementation code. Practical takeaway: using the right representation can make safety analyses and audits more tractable. 

---

# 02-Transformer-Overview/Model-Simplifications.md
# Model Simplifications
This lesson explains the paper’s focus on attention-only toy transformers, omitting MLPs, biases, and layernorm (folded into weights) for clarity. The aim is to reduce complexity so mechanisms in attention become legible, acknowledging limitations and future extensions. Conceptually, simplifying assumptions help isolate interpretability-relevant behaviors. To be specified for any implementation nuances not detailed in the paper. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

# 02-Transformer-Overview/High-Level-Architecture.md
# High-Level Architecture
Here we cover token embeddings, residual blocks, attention heads, and unembedding. The lesson clarifies how attention and MLP components read from and write to the residual stream. The goal is to understand transformers as modular computations added into a shared channel. To be specified for any production deployment constraints not described by the paper. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

# 03-Residual-Stream-and-Virtual-Weights/README.md
# Virtual Weights & Residual Stream as Communication Channel
This module introduces the residual stream as a linear, shared communication channel and the idea of “virtual weights” (implicit connections formed by matrix products across layers). Understanding these provides a roadmap for tracing information flow. Security-minded readers should note that interpretable pathways help detect unexpected behaviors. To be specified where runtime or library details are not in scope. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

# 03-Residual-Stream-and-Virtual-Weights/Virtual-Weights.md
# Virtual Weights
This lesson focuses on implicit “virtual weights” that arise from multiplying read/write projections across layers, revealing how later components read earlier outputs. The goal is to give learners a mental model for long-range interactions without peeking at activations. To be specified for quantitative diagnostics not provided in the paper. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

# 03-Residual-Stream-and-Virtual-Weights/Subspaces-and-Residual-Bandwidth.md

Learners connect this to capacity, interference, and interpretability. To be specified for deployment monitoring strategies beyond the paper. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

# 04-Attention-Heads-Independent-and-Additive/README.md
# Attention Heads: Independent and Additive
This lesson reframes attention layers as sums of independent head outputs added to the residual stream, favoring interpretability over the concatenate-and-project view. The scope is the additive structure and its consequences. Practically, treating heads as separate components can simplify audits and testing. To be specified for library-level performance trade-offs. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

# 04-Attention-Heads-Independent-and-Additive/Attention-as-Information-Movement.md
# Attention as Information Movement
We unpack attention heads as mechanisms that move information from source tokens to destination tokens, separating “where to attend” (QK) from “what to write” (OV). The goal is to internalize the head as two coupled linear maps with a non-linear attention pattern. This framing supports later lessons on composition. To be specified for operational thresholds or tooling not specified. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

# 05-Zero-Layer-Transformers/README.md
# Zero-Layer Transformers
A zero-layer model reduces to bigram statistics via direct embedding-to-unembedding paths. Learners see how even this simplest case appears in deeper models as a “direct path” term. The lesson situates bigrams as a baseline for understanding higher-layer effects. Resources below are explicitly cited by the paper.

---

# 06-One-Layer-Attention-Only-Transformers/QK-and-OV-Circuits.md

The goal is to demystify parameters by mapping them to token-level effects. To be specified for tooling recipes beyond scope. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

---

# 06-One-Layer-Attention-Only-Transformers/Copying-and-Primitive-ICL.md

---

# 06-One-Layer-Attention-Only-Transformers/Skip-Trigram-Bugs.md

Factored (QK × OV) representations can raise undesired combinations (e.g., keep… in bay). The lesson frames these as interpretable error modes for auditing. To be specified for quantitative impact estimates beyond the paper. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

---

# 06-One-Layer-Attention-Only-Transformers/Summarizing-OV-QK-Matrices.md

The goal is to understand why statistics like eigenvalues are informative yet imperfect. To be specified for chosen decomposition methods. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

---

# 06-One-Layer-Attention-Only-Transformers/Detecting-Copying-Behavior.md
